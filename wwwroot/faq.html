						<p>In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TED has created a program called TEDx. TEDx is a program of 
							local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. Our event

						</p>

						<p>At our <strong>TEDxPretoria</strong> event, TEDTalks video and live speakers will combine to spark 
							deep discussion and connection in a small group. The TED Conference provides general guidance for 
							the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events, including ours, are self-organized.
